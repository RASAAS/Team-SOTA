## CLINICAL BACKGROUND (STATE-OF-THE-ART)

### Clinical Background

Multi-Use Syringeless Injectors (MUSI) are advanced CT contrast media injection systems designed to enhance the efficiency and safety of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) examinations. These systems utilize large-volume contrast media containers and peristaltic pump technology to deliver iodinated contrast media at controlled flow rates and volumes, improving image quality and diagnostic accuracy. (Toia et al. 2023)

MUSI systems are increasingly adopted in high-volume imaging environments where efficiency is crucial. They are particularly beneficial for patients with difficult venous access, where peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) may be used for contrast administration (Wortley and Almerol 2020). The clinical context for MUSI systems includes:

1. Growing demand for contrast-enhanced CT examinations, with over 50% of CT procedures requiring contrast media administration (Kemper et al. 2022).
2. Emphasis on patient safety, particularly regarding air embolism prevention and PICC tip positioning (Kemper et al. 2022) (Wortley and Almerol 2020).
3. Increasing focus on environmental sustainability and waste reduction in radiology practices (Toia et al. 2023).

MUSI systems often incorporate advanced features such as proactive air management, which aims to reduce the risk of air embolism during contrast injection (Kemper et al. 2022). They also allow for multiple patient use without changing the contrast media container, potentially improving workflow efficiency and reducing waste (Toia et al. 2023).

### Alternative Options

Single-Use Syringe-Based Injectors (SUSI) are a traditional method for CT contrast media administration. These systems use disposable syringes and tubing for each patient, typically with separate syringes for contrast media and saline. SUSI systems often incorporate air detection sensors but use a reactive approach to air management. They generally result in higher waste generation compared to newer technologies (Toia et al. 2023) (Kemper et al. 2022).

Manual injection of contrast media is sometimes used, particularly for central venous catheters. However, a study at a children's hospital found that hand injection of IV contrast material led to damage of central venous catheters in 0.3% of cases over a 6-year period. The study suggests that hand injection can generate high and inconsistent pressures, potentially leading to catheter damage. Unlike power injection, the pressure and rate of injection during hand administration are unknown and uncontrolled. This evidence challenges the assumption that manual injection is necessarily safer than power injection for central venous catheters (Donnelly, Dickerson, and Racadio 2007).
