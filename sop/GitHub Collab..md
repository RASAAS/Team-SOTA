If you would like to work together with me, you can register an account in [GitHub](https://github.com/). 

And then,

```
git clone https://github.com/RASAAS/Team-SOTA.git
cd Team-SOTA
```

> [!NOTE]
> You may need to [install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to import a new project into Git, make changes to it, and share changes with other developers. 


You can create a new device type if there is no such type exist. Or, you can also update the exist device type SOTA contents if you think it is necessary.

When you are making updates, please make sure you are using Branches other than `main`, in this way, we can have better version control and doc management.

For details of using GitHub, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git).
