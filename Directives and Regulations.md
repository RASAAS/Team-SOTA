The following Directives or Regulations might be applicable to Medical Devices, make assessments and apply for CE-mark.


### [Regulation 2016/425 (Personnel Protective Equipment)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016R0425)

Personal protective equipment (PPE) are products that the user can wear or hold, to be protected against risks either at work, at home or whilst engaging in leisure activities. the PPE regulation covers the **design, manufacture and marketing of personal protective equipment**. It defines legal obligations to ensure that PPE on the EU internal market provides the highest level of protection against risks. The [CE marking](https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/single-market/ce-marking/manufacturers_en) affixed to PPE provides evidence of compliance of the product with the applicable EU legislation.

The [PPE regulation guidelines](https://ec.europa.eu/docsroom/documents/56514) (3rd edition - October 2023) aim to facilitate a common understanding and implementation of the PPE regulation.

### [Regulation 2023/1230/EU (Machinery)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/1230/oj)

This Regulation lays down health and safety requirements for the design and construction of machinery, placed on the European market.

_Regulation (EU) 2023/1230 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2023 on machinery_ replaces [Directive 2006/42/EC on machinery](https://osha.europa.eu/en/legislation/directives/directive-2006-42-ec-of-the-european-parliament-and-of-the-council). The regulation - as did the 2006 directive - defines the mandatory essential health and safety requirements that machinery products must fulfil to be placed on the European market, as well as the procedures for assessing their conformity, while the technical details are mainly provided through European harmonised standards elaborated by European standards organisations. The requirements of the Regulation are aimed at machinery manufacturers and other economic operators such as importers. The CE marking indicates that the machinery product meets the health and safety requirements in place and can be traded without restriction in the internal market.

####  Directive 2006/66/EU (Battery Directive)

To combat the Battery Safety issues the European Union (EU) published the [EU New Battery Regulation (EU) 2023/1542](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02023R1542-20230728) on July 28, 2023, in the Official Journal of the European Union. Just weeks later on August 17, 2023, the Regulation was officially put into effect. It covers all batteries available on the EU market and aims to improve sustainability, safety labeling, and waste management. The Regulation supports the shift to a circular economy and increases the security of supply for raw materials.

The EU New Battery Regulation includes both rechargeable and non-rechargeable batteries. It is relevant for manufacturers of cells, modules, battery packs, energy storage systems, EV battery systems, and end products utilizing batteries. The regulation itself casts a broad net, encompassing battery categories such as waste portable batteries, electric vehicle batteries, industrial batteries, starting, lightning, and ignition batteries, and batteries for light means of transportation such as e-bikes, mopeds, and e-scooters. While specific rules within the regulation place stricter requirements on larger batteries exceeding 2 kWh, batteries of all sizes are affected.

### [Directive 2014/53/EU (RED)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2014/53/oj)

The **Radio Equipment Directive** (**RED**) established a regulatory framework for placing [radio equipment](https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/single-market/european-standards/harmonised-standards/radio-equipment_en) on the market in the EU. All radio equipment within the scope of this directive that are placed on the EU market must have been compliant with the directive from 13 June 2017. The delay of the publication and approval of the details of this directive has led to difficulties for companies attempting to comply with the directive.

#### Directive 2012/19/EU (WEEE)

The [WEEE Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02012L0019-20180704) and the [RoHS Directive](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02011L0065-20160715) tackle the issue of the growing amount of WEEE.

The WEEE Directive:
- requires the separate collection and proper treatment of WEEE and sets targets for their collection, recovery and recycling
- helps European countries fight illegal waste exports more effectively by making it harder for exporters to disguise illegal shipments of WEEE
- reduces the administrative burden by calling for the harmonisation of national EEE registers and of the reporting format

### [Regulation 1907/2006 (REACH)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02006R1907-20231201)

REACH stands for Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals. It entered into force on 1 June 2007.

REACH is a regulation of the European Union, adopted to improve the protection of human health and the environment from the risks that can be posed by chemicals, while enhancing the competitiveness of the EU chemicals industry. It also promotes alternative methods for the hazard assessment of substances in order to reduce the number of tests on animals. 

In principle, REACH applies to all chemical substances; not only those used in industrial processes but also in our day-to-day lives, for example in cleaning products, paints as well as in articles such as clothes, furniture and electrical appliances. Therefore, the regulation has an impact on most companies across the EU.

### [Directive 2011/65/EU (ROHS)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02011L0065-20240801)

EU laws restrict the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment through the [RoHS Directive](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02011L0065-20160715). In parallel, [the WEEE Directive](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/topics/waste-and-recycling/waste-electrical-and-electronic-equipment-weee_en) promotes the collection and recycling of such equipment.

The RoHS Directive currently restricts the use of ten substances: lead, cadmium, mercury, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP).

All products with an electrical and electronic component, unless specifically excluded, have to comply with these restrictions.

In 2017, the Commission adopted a [legislative proposal](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1485526057244&uri=CELEX:52017PC0038) adjusting the scope of the RoHS Directive.
