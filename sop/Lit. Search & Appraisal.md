### Literature research purpose

The purpose of the literature search is to gather data from scientific literature and safety databases. This data will be evaluated for both the state-of-the-art (SOTA) discussion and the discussion of a specific device (if an equivalent device is available).

### SOTA

The state-of-the-art research should encompass the following areas:
- **Clinical background of the device under evaluation**: This includes the indication for the device and its historical diagnosis or treatment practices. An extended discussion may cover patient health conditions, prevalence and progression of the disease, and the gold standard for diagnosis or treatment of the indication.
- **Newer methods** for the indication: This involves the most recently developed approaches and/or innovative diagnostic or treatment methods within the medical technology field that are similar to the device under evaluation.
- **Alternative options** for the intended population: This includes conservative, surgical, and medicinal treatments available for the population intended to use the device.
- **Benchmark or Similar Devices**:This involves listing typical and widely used devices that are comparable to the device under evaluation.
- **Applicable Standards and Guidance Documents**: This includes relevant international standards, EU MDR (Medical Device Regulation), and associated guidelines.

#### Research Questions for SOTA

Research questions related to state-of-the-art information should be formulated to capture performance and safety endpoints, as well as any claims of clinical benefits (if applicable).

Additionally, the research questions should consider alternative options or newer methods for the intended population and indication. This information is typically found in meta-analyses or systematic review articles.

If there are other uncertain questions or plans to investigate different indications, populations, or health conditions, the relevant keywords should be included in the search terms.

#### Search Terms

The keywords for the SOTA search should represent the clinical and technical claims, the indications, and the clinical safety and performance endpoints. These keywords should be combined using Boolean logic to create effective search strategies that retrieve relevant results.

The following guidelines can be used to develop search terms:

1. **Clinical and Technical Claims:** Include terms related to the primary claims of the device, such as its intended use, primary functions, and key technological features.
2. **Indications:** Use terms that describe the medical condition or disease that the device is intended to diagnose, monitor, or treat.
3. **Clinical Safety and Performance Endpoints:** Include terms that describe the outcomes related to the safety and effectiveness of the device.

##### Boolean Logic in Search Strategies

Using Boolean operators can help refine and focus the search results:

**AND:** Combines keywords to narrow the search to results that include all specified terms.
    - Example: "device function" AND "disease name" AND "clinical safety."
**OR:** Broadens the search to include results that contain any of the specified terms.
    - Example: "device function" OR "technological feature."
**NOT:** Excludes results that contain specified terms to filter out irrelevant information.
    - Example: "device function" NOT "unrelated feature."

##### Example Search Strategy

To illustrate, an example search strategy for a device designed to treat a specific heart condition might include:

1. Clinical and Technical Claims: "heart valve replacement," "minimally invasive."
2. Indications: "aortic stenosis," "mitral valve disease."
3. Clinical Safety and Performance Endpoints: "surgical outcomes," "patient recovery," "device durability."

Combining these with Boolean logic:

- "heart valve replacement" AND "aortic stenosis" AND "surgical outcomes"
- "minimally invasive" OR "heart valve replacement"
- "aortic stenosis" NOT "mitral valve disease"

By carefully selecting and combining keywords using Boolean logic, the search strategy will yield comprehensive and relevant literature to support the SOTA and specific device discussions.

#### Filter for search results

Scientific articles can be searched from PubMed and Embase. If Embase is not available, use ScienceDirect as an alternative.

##### PubMed

For collecting "SOTA" data, apply the following filters: `5 years`, `full text`, and `Humans`. This filtered search will be recorded as Search #1, which will be used for further appraisal.

From Search #1, further narrow down the results by selecting "Meta-Analysis", "Systematic Review", and "Randomized Controlled Trial". This refined search will be recorded as Search #2.

##### Embase

Similar to PubMed, use the same search terms but apply the filters: `5 years` publications, `Article` publication type, and `human` study type. The results with these filters will be marked as Search #2 (the initial search without filters is Search #1).

Next, further refine by selecting "Meta-Analysis", "Systematic Review", and "Randomized Controlled Trial" records, which will be recorded as Search #3.

#### Literature Management 

Export the records seperately from the databases, i.e. #1 and #2 from PubMed, and #1, #2, and #3 from Embase. 

Import them into note management tools, such as EndNote or Zotero, for further organization. For example, in EndNote, create different groups for all these records:

```
- PubMed-#1-all
- PubMed-#2-SOTA
- Embase-#2-all
- Embase-#3-SOTA
```

> [!NOTE]
> Since `SOTA` is included in the `all` records, SOTA articles will be screened and appraised first. After this step, use the note management tool to find and remove duplicated articles.

When screening and appraising the SOTA articles (Search #2 from PubMed and Search #3 from Embase), remove duplicated articles during this step.

##### SOTA articles screening

###### Remove duplicated SOTA articles

Combine the PubMed and Embase `SOTA` groups into one group named `SOTA Group` in EndNote. Copy articles from `PubMed-#2-SOTA` and `Embase-#3-SOTA` into this group. Select **References** -> **Find Duplicates** and remove all duplicated articles from the SOTA groups. Then, delete the `SOTA Group`.

###### Read Title and Abstract 

Export the SOTA articles from EndNote (only export the title and abstract), then use AIs tool for the initial screening to determine if the article is relevant to the device and its intended use.

Based on the articles' titles and abstracts to determine the relevance. 
 >This process can be done by AI tools.

##### SOTA Appraisal

Read every article that is relevant and extract the information that can be referenced in the CEP/CER for #SOTA.

> **AI tools can make this process much more efficient.**  

For the full-text reading, before using the AI tool, it is recommended to [[Convert the PDF to Markdown]] file for better analysis by the AI. 









### Specific Device (Optional)

The discussion on a specific device should involve thorough research tailored to its intended use and clinical performance. This research should use the device's trade name, model name, or manufacturer's name in the search terms to retrieve relevant data. The areas covered will be similar to those in the state-of-the-art (SOTA) search but with a focus on the specific device.

#### Research Questions for Specific Device

Research questions for the specific device should aim to capture detailed information on its clinical performance and safety. 

Additionally, the research should explore the clinical context and patient populations for which the device is intended. Information from clinical trials, case studies, and regulatory databases will be particularly valuable.

#### Search Terms

The keywords for researching a specific device should include its trade name, model name, or manufacturer's name combined with terms reflecting its design, intended use, clinical performance, and safety. Combining these keywords with Boolean logic will help to refine and focus the search results.
